# Rules that are ignored:
#
# The following rule now goes against PEP8:
#       W503 line break before binary operator
#
# The following rules are incompatible with or largely enforced by black:
#       B950 Line too long (flake8-bugbear equivalent of E501)
#       E203 whitespace before
#       E501 line too long
#       W291 trailing whitespace
#       W293 blank line contains whitespace
#
# I disagree with these stylistic lints from flake8-pytest-style and flake8-simplify
#       SIM905
#       PT004
#       PT005
#
# This flake8-bugbear rule has a *huge* number of false positives:
#       B907
