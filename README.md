## What's this project for?

This project is for easy gathering of statistics relating to [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed)'s stubs. As well as being a CLI tool and library, it also powers [a website](https://alexwaygood.github.io/typeshed-stats/) where stats about typeshed's stubs are uploaded twice a day.

This project was created by Alex Waygood. It is not necessarily endorsed by any of the other typeshed maintainers.

Some examples of things you can do from the command line:

- Create a `.csv` file with stats on all typeshed stubs: `typeshed-stats --typeshed-dir <PATH_TO_TYPESHED_CLONE> --to-file stats.csv` (the `.csv` file extension will be automatically detected by the script to identify the format required).
- Pretty-print stats on typeshed stubs for emoji and redis to the terminal, in JSON format: `typeshed-stats --typeshed-dir <PATH_TO_TYPESHED_CLONE> --to-json emoji redis`
- Generate a MarkDown file detailing stats on typeshed's stubs for protobuf and the stdlib: `typeshed-stats --typeshed-dir <PATH_TO_TYPESHED_CLONE> --to-file stats.md stdlib protobuf`

Example usage of the Python-level API:

```python
from typeshed_stats.gather import tmpdir_typeshed, gather_stats

with tmpdir_typeshed() as typeshed:
    stats_on_all_packages = gather_stats_on_multiple_packages(typeshed_dir=typeshed)
```

## How can I use this?

1. Run `pip install typeshed-stats[rich]` to install the package
1. Run `typeshed-stats --help` for information about various options

## Are there any examples of things this script can produce, other than [the website](https://alexwaygood.github.io/typeshed-stats/)?

I'm glad you asked! They're in the `examples/` folder in this repo.
(These examples are generated using the `regenerate.py` script in the `scripts/` directory.)

## How do I run tests/linters?

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
1. Run `pip install -e .[dev]`
1. Either run the linters/tests individually (see the `.github/workflows` directory for details about what's run in CI) or use the `scripts/runtests.py` convenience script to run them all in succession.
